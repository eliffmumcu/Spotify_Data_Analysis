# Spotify_Data_Analysis

Motivation
The motivation behind this project lies in the desire to gain comprehensive insights into my music streaming habits and preferences between the dates 05.12.2022 and 05.12.2023 on Spotify app. By analyzing the extensive dataset capturing my listening history, the goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and notable statistics related to the artists and songs that dominate my streaming experience. This project aims to provide a detailed exploration of my musical journey, identifying favorite tracks, preferred time slots for streaming and much more. This exploration is not only a personal quest to rediscover favorite tracks and moments but also an opportunity to enhance my data analysis skills and utilize various visualization techniques. Through this project, I hope to gain valuable insights into how my music preferences evolve, the impact of seasons or times of the day on my listening habits, and any other intriguing aspects that may emerge from the data.
